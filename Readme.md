# rust password manager
This is a simple password manager made as a side project by me to learn rust and encryption techniques.

**WHILST THIS PROJECT USES PREMADE LIBRARIES FOR IMPORTANT PARTS OF THIS PROJECT (ENCRYPTION, PBKDF AND HASHING) THIS PROJECT SHOULD NOT BE USED IN PART OR IN WHOLE FOR ANY REAL USE-CASES THERE ARE FULLY MADE (AND FREE) SOLUTIONS OUT THERE**

I got the idea of making this from Keepassxc

# TODO LIST
### search functionality 
### frontend of some sorts to get some UI
